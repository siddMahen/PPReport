# Personal Project Report

Due to the mathematical nature of cryptography and cryptanalysis,
I have chosen to write my final essay as a LaTeX document.

Note that this is not my reflection report, but rather my "product".

## Requirements

To render this document, a LaTeX software package as well as the
following non-standard LaTeX packages are required:

* [`minted`](http://minted.googlecode.com/files/minted-v1.7.zip)

This document was rendered on my machine using MacTeX (available
[here](http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/)).

## Compiling and Rendering

To compile and render this document, run the following commands from the
root directory of the project:

```
$ cd LaTeX
$ make render
```

Note that the document will need to be rendered again if changes are made.
